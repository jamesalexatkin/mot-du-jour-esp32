# 🇫🇷 Mot du jour ESP32 code

Mot du jour allows an ESP32 chip with an e-ink display to show a random French word each day.

It communicates with [a proxy API](https://github.com/jamesalexatkin/mot-du-jour-api) that fetches words from Wiktionary.

## 🏃 To run

Clone the repo and flash it to a chip in Arduino IDE.
